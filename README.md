# Computational Astrophysics

This is the GitHub where I upload all the work from the Computational Astrophysics course from the Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics, speciality of Astrophysics, at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM).

This is a course in High Performance Computing (HPC) using examples of Astrophysics.
